- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving life for humanity and ecology
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning IoT, AR and VR
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project that needs help
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about coding and opensource
- âš¡ Fun fact: Open source projects often have vibrant communities surrounding them. These communities provide support, share knowledge, and help newcomers get started with the project. It's a great way to learn from others and grow your skills.
